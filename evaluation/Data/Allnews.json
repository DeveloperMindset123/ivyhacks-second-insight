The copper is used in turbines that convert rotational energy into electric energy. In fact, more copper is used in wind and solar energy production than in traditional fossil fuel stations.\nIt\u2019s akin to when China\u2019s tiger economy was growing at double-digit percentages every year throughout the 1990s.
