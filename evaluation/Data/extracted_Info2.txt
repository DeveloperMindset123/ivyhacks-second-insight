### Risk vs. Stability Visualizations Concept

While I can't provide visualizations, I recommend creating or seeking the following types of charts using financial software or platforms that support stock market data:

- **Growth Projections**: Line charts showing historical and projected earnings growth, revenue, and stock price performance.
- **Profit/Loss Likelihood**: Monte Carlo simulations or risk/reward ratio scatter plots.
- **Risk vs. Stability**: Beta values plotted against average returns for each stock could help visualize volatility versus return potential. Stocks like JNJ and PG might show lower risk but stable returns, while TSLA and NVDA might exhibit higher volatility but also higher growth potential.

### Conclusion

Investing in AAPL seems promising given its market position and future growth avenues, but it's not without risks, especially regulatory ones. Diversifying your portfolio across different sectors can help mitigate these risks. When visualizing data for decision-making, focus on growth trends, risk assessments, and comparing the stability of various investments. This diversified approach balances potential high-growth investments with stable, lower-risk assets, aiming for a well-rounded portfolio.
